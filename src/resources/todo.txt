- Installation (First time run, system dependant)
	- Moves core files into place
	- Choose language (English, Japanese)
	- Choose area/location
	- Choose minimum magnitude (to notify above)

- OS Only notifications
	(Have different notifications depending on system)

- GUI Window Popup
	- Shows Map with Epicenter location and estimated effect radius

- Audio
	- Play sound multiple times
	- Use a different sound depending on Earthquake Intensity

- Silent Mode
	- After hours, warning sound will only play if above specified magnitude

- Epoch Converter
	- Automatically convert quake.eq_date to readable format

- Only show notification if quake.training_type = 0

- Determine effected area and only notify those within or near the specified area. (eg, quake is in tokyo, notify saitama, akita, shibuya, and surrounding prefectures)

- Run in Daemon/Background
	(Figure out a way to have the programs be open, without the program window needing to be open)

- Internet connection
	- Notification if failed to get API
	- If failed to get api, try again in 5 minutes

- GUI Window
	- Opens when the event is triggered
	- Google Maps API, place Epicenter (from lat,long) and draws Radius (eqradius.json)

- Localization
	- Implement a way to use different language strings from files in /localization

- Epicenter Codes
	- Be able to translate "epicenter_code" to the string in /localization/epicenter.json
		(quake.epicenter_code (42) turns into "Fukuoka Prefecture")

- Local Alerts
	- Only shows notification if you're within 250km of the epicenter, and it's under magnitude 6.4
		(If quake is above 6.4, show the event anyway [regardless of location])
